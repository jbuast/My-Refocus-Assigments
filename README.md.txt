Hi Sensei! I am Justine Jurel Valenzuela. I am 22 years old. I am from Bacolod City.
I am a graduating student from TUP Visayas. My hobbies are reading non-fiction books,
I am training my self to let coding become a hobby for me because if you are doing things
that make you happy, it makes life at ease. My goal for this year is to become a 
full stack web developer and also to have a great physique. Actually, the first reason I 
wanted to become a developer because of it is a high paying job but eventually I realized 
that this is my passion and I love coding.
